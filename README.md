# LED-Responder

## Full Control. No Mistakes. No Mercy.

**Project # 7** in the embedded arsenal. This ain’t just “light up when pressed.” This is **state control**. Lock in one LED. Lock out the others. No multitasking. No chaos. Reset is your only escape.

## 🧭 Why This Matters

**Real-time systems** demand clarity. When one system is active, others wait. This isn’t multitasking — this is **prioritized response**. If you can’t control a few LEDs with discipline, forget controlling motors, sensors, or a whole robot. This teaches **single-state dominance**.

### ⚙️ What I Learned

- `digitalRead()` to sense input like a sniper  
- `while()` locks logic tight — no bouncing out  
- `digitalWrite()` for precise output control  
- Hardware reset button = kill switch mentality  
- Structure your logic like a machine — not a maybe
